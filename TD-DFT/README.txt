With TD-DFT only benchmark and testing was done.

For benchmark the same 20 molecules were used. The benchmark folder contains all of the data.

For test dataset, only 200 molecules with lower molecular weight were selected for the expensive TDDFT calculation with B2PLYP. The SCF did not converge for #245, #573, #577, so they were rerun with 'defgrid3' and 'NOSOSCF'.
